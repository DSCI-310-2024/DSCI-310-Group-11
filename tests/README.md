# Developer Notes for Testing

## Running the tests

The tests can be run by typing `pytest tests/*` on the command line. Note that the tests will have to be run after all the scripts are run.

## Test Files

The `.zip` files and `.json` files in the data folder should be left as is and the `test_parquet` folder will be populated with data once the tests are run. The `.zip` and `.json` files should 
not be deleted or moved in any situation!
